    Photography is the art, application, and practice of creating durable
    images by recording light, either electronically by means of an image
    sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as
    photographic film. It is employed in many fields of science, manufacturing
    (e.g., photolithography), and business, as well as its more direct uses
    for art, film and video production, recreational purposes, hobby, and mass
    communication.

    Photo is a photograph of a person or thing in which the face and features
    are clearly visible. It was invented in 1826 by person name Joseph
    Nicéphore Niépce. He was born on 7 March 1765 and died on 5 July 1833. He
    was a French inventor, now usually credited as the inventor of photography
    and a pioneer in that field. Niépce developed heliography, a technique
    used to produce the world's first known photograph in 1825. He used a
    coated piece of paper and placed it in a camera obscura. The first image
    he captured was of a view from his window. He called it "View from the
    Window at Le Gras". It was taken in 1826. It was a black and white photo.
