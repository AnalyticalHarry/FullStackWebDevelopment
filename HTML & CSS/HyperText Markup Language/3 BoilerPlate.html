            <h2>What is data science?</h2>
            <p>Data science is the study of data to extract meaningful insights
                for business. It is a multidisciplinary approach that combines
                principles and practices from the fields of mathematics,
                statistics, artificial intelligence, and computer engineering to
                analyze large amounts of data. This analysis helps data
                scientists to ask and answer questions like what happened, why
                it happened, what will happen, and what can be done with the
                results.</p>

            <h2>Why is data science important?</h2>
            <p>Data science is important because it combines tools, methods, and
                technology to generate meaning from data. Modern organizations
                are inundated with data; there is a proliferation of devices
                that can automatically collect and store information. Online
                systems and payment portals capture more data in the fields of
                e-commerce, medicine, finance, and every other aspect of human
                life. We have text, audio, video, and image data available in
                vast quantities. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>History of data science</h2>
            <p>While the term data science is not new, the meanings and
                connotations have changed over time. The word first appeared in
                the ’60s as an alternative name for statistics. In the late
                ’90s, computer science professionals formalized the term. A
                proposed definition for data science saw it as a separate field
                with three aspects: data design, collection, and analysis. It
                still took another decade for the term to be used outside of
                academia.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Future of data science</h2>
            <p>Artificial intelligence and machine learning innovations have
                made data processing faster and more efficient. Industry demand
                has created an ecosystem of courses, degrees, and job positions
                within the field of data science. Because of the
                cross-functional skillset and expertise required, data science
                shows strong projected growth over the coming decades.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>What is data science used for?</h2>
            <b>Data science is used to study data in four main ways:</b>
            <div>
                <h3>1. Descriptive analysis</h3>
                <p>Descriptive analysis examines data to gain insights into what
                    happened or what is happening in the data environment. It is
                    characterized by data visualizations such as pie charts, bar
                    charts, line graphs, tables, or generated narratives. For
                    example, a flight booking service may record data like the
                    number of tickets booked each day. Descriptive analysis will
                    reveal booking spikes, booking slumps, and high-performing
                    months for this service.</p>
                <h3>2. Diagnostic analysis</h3>
                <p>Diagnostic analysis is a deep-dive or detailed data
                    examination to understand why something happened. It is
                    characterized by techniques such as drill-down, data
                    discovery, data mining, and correlations. Multiple data
                    operations and transformations may be performed on a given
                    data set to discover unique patterns in each of these
                    techniques.For example, the flight service might drill down
                    on a particularly high-performing month to better understand
                    the booking spike. This may lead to the discovery that many
                    customers visit a particular city to attend a monthly
                    sporting event.</p>
                <h3>3. Predictive analysis</h3>
                <p>Predictive analysis uses historical data to make accurate
                    forecasts about data patterns that may occur in the future.
                    It is characterized by techniques such as machine learning,
                    forecasting, pattern matching, and predictive modeling. In
                    each of these techniques, computers are trained to reverse
                    engineer causality connections in the data.For example, the
                    flight service team might use data science to predict flight
                    booking patterns for the coming year at the start of each
                    year. The computer program or algorithm may look at past
                    data and predict booking spikes for certain destinations in
                    May. Having anticipated their customer’s future travel
                    requirements, the company could start targeted advertising
                    for those cities from February.</p>
                <h3>4. Prescriptive analysis</h3>
                <p>Prescriptive analytics takes predictive data to the next
                    level. It not only predicts what is likely to happen but
                    also suggests an optimum response to that outcome. It can
                    analyze the potential implications of different choices and
                    recommend the best course of action. It uses graph analysis,
                    simulation, complex event processing, neural networks, and
                    recommendation engines from machine learning.</p>
                <p>Back to the flight booking example, prescriptive analysis
                    could look at historical marketing campaigns to maximize the
                    advantage of the upcoming booking spike. A data scientist
                    could project booking outcomes for different levels of
                    marketing spend on various marketing channels. These data
                    forecasts would give the flight booking company greater
                    confidence in their marketing decisions.</p>
